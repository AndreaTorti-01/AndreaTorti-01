# Andrea Torti

I obtained my Master's Degree in Computer Science and Engineering @ Politecnico di Milano in 2025 and I specialized in low-level programming and optimization, with a some computer graphics, computer vision, robotics, embedded development and AI sprinkled here and there. I even wrote a lot of raw CUDA code and obtained a couple certifications from Nvidia! During my academic career, I loved hands-on projects the most, where I could have control over every piece of the software I was developing and take pride in the results. Most of them were group projects, and that's where I discovered that I perform the best working with a team on tough problems and under strict deadlines. Some were developed on Windows, most on Linux, but I also daily macOS.


Here's a preview of some of my work, but there's always something more that's work in progress... always building, always learning!
